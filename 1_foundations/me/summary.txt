"I’m Abhinandan Deshpande, a detail-oriented Test Engineer with hands-on experience in functional, regression, integration, and sanity testing for both web and mobile applications. Outside of work, I’m a passionate cricket player and a food enthusiast — I love South Indian cuisine, but honestly, I enjoy exploring pretty much every type of cuisine. Professionally, I’m skilled in automation using Selenium, Tosca, and Java, and I have a solid understanding of SDLC, STLC, test design techniques, and test strategy. I’ve worked extensively with tools like Jira, ALM, and Azure DevOps for defect management, test planning, and execution in both Agile and Waterfall environments. My domain expertise spans financial services, investment banking, and corporate action. I’m also deeply interested in emerging technologies like GenAI, LangChain, LangGraph, Prompt Engineering, OpenAI SDK, CrewAI, MCP, and workflow automation with n8n. I hold certifications including ISTQB Foundation Level, AWS Certified Developer – Associate, Google AI Essentials, and Full Stack Development. I thrive in global delivery environments, enjoy mentoring junior testers, and take pride in ensuring software meets the highest quality standards."
